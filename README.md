# Trails of Dust 20xx

An adaptation of the game presented in the [_Let's Learn Godot 4 by Making an RPG_](https://dev.to/christinec_dev/lets-learn-godot-4-by-making-an-rpg-part-1-project-overview-setup-bgc)
tutorial series by @christinec-dev.

Eventually, the plan is to make this a cyberpunk-western-fusion version of the
original game. For now though, I'm just learning how Godot works, so it's pretty
close to the original game still.

## Asset Credits

Currently, all assets are unmodified from the original tutorial game. Eventually,
I'd like to use some sci-fi western assets instead. I may end up modifying some
of these asset packs for my own uses.

Anyways, the current list of used assets is:
